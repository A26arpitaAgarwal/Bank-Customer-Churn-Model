#Abstract
Customer churn is a major problem of customers leaving your products and moving to another services. Due to direct or indirect effects on profit margins, bussinesses now are looking to identify customers who are at the risk of churning and retaining them by personalized promotional offers.
In order to retain them, they need to identify the customers as well as the reason of churning so that they can provide the customers with personalized offers and products. The aim of our project is to solve this problem for banking domain, by identifying which customers are at risk of churning and what are the reasons for churning with the help of data mining and machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on 2 deliverables - Predict customers likely to churn using supervised learning classification algorithms and customer segmentation of customers using unsupervised learning to validate the similarities in the ‘likely to churn’ customer subset to come up with different segments. The reasons for a particular customer churn can vary from internal factors as well as external factors but we will try to understand the reasons of churning depending on internal factors using explainable AI, which breaks into the blackbox of machine learning algorithms and gives a clear explanation of the predictions.
